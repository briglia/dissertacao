\begin{abstract}
Cache memory compression was originally developed for desktop and server platforms, but has also attracted interest on embeded systems where memory is generally a scarce resource, and hardware changes bring more costs and energy consumption. The project evaluated in this paper acts in RAM memory of embedded devices, creating a virtual compressed area for memory swapping. The tests included in MiBench were used to test this new memory hierarchy. We will describe the Compressed Cache design and tests methodology used to test the memory consumption behavior.
\end{abstract}

\Section{Introduction}

Most of embedded systems has as common characteristic: your usage for single specific tasks. But embedded systems for general purpose are pretty common as well \cite{mor00}. Linux is an Operational System which can be used in embedded devices. Embedded devices, such as PDA's (Personal Data Assistance), netbooks and Internet tablets, can use Linux as Operational System, allowing users to have access to multimedia content and other tasks which demands a higher processing capacity and memory storage.

Regarding processor power, there is no much to do instead of change the processor. But, for memory capacity, there are some solutions that do not depend on hardware changes. Compressed caching is the introduction of a new level into the virtual memory hierarchy.\cite{briglia07, castro03}. RAM (Random Access Memory), is used to store normal memory pages and compressed memory pages. Creating a reserved area called ramzswap, Compressed Cache uses this area for memory swapping. As used by several Operational Systems, swap areas intends to increase the virtual memory storage.

As presented in \cite{briglia07}, not only input and output rates could be improved when Compcache is used, but also the system behavior. Especially in memory-critical cases leading, Compcache can be used to ameliorate the Out-of-memory conditions. Tests used in \cite{briglia07} did not use MiBench \cite{GRE01} to evaluate the memory consumption behavior. Since MiBench is largely used in embedded systems evaluations, this paper presents Compcache usage against MiBench benchmarks.

\Section{Compressed Caching}

\subsection{Linux Virtual Memory Overview}

Physical pages are the basic unit of memory management \cite{love05kerneldevel} and the MMU is the hardware that translates virtual pages addresses into physical pages address and vice-versa. This compressed caching implementation, CCache \cite{ccache06}, adds some new flags to help with compressed pages identification and uses the same lists used by the PFRA (Page Frame Reclaiming Algorithm). When the system is under a low memory condition, it evicts pages from memory. It uses Least Recently Used (LRU) criteria to determine order in which to evict pages. It maintains two LRU lists---active and inactive LRU lists. These lists may contain both page-cache (file-backed) and swap-cache (anonymous) pages. When under memory pressure, pages in inactive list are freed as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Swap-cache pages are written out to swap disks using swapper\_space writepage() (swap\_writepage()).

\item Dirty page-cache pages are flushed to filesystem disks using filesystem specific writepage().

\item Clean page-cache pages are simply freed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{About Swap Cache}

This is the cache for anonymous pages. All swap cache pages are part of a single swapper\_space. A single radix tree maintains all pages in the swap cache. swp\_entry\_t is used as a key to locate the corresponding pages in memory. This value identifies the location in swap device reserved for this page.

\subsubsection{About Page Cache}
This is the cache for file-system pages. Like swap cache, this also uses radix-tree to keep track of file pages. Here, the offset in file is used as the search key. Each open file has a separate radix-tree. For pages present in memory, the corresponding radix-node points to struct page for the memory page containing file data at that offset.

\SubSection{Compressed Cache Overview}
Compressed Cache (Compcache), is a technique which adds a new level in Linux memory hierarchy \cite{castro03, douglis93, kaplan99compressed}. Compcache is used to improve the memory pages access time in Linux kernel, storing more pages in RAM memory instead of slow block devices (used in regular swap\footnote{Swap area is a reserved portion from the filesystem which intends to increase the available virtual memory amount, improving the free memory for user applications.} areas) and avoiding that more pages were discarded. It is known that swap areas are slower than main memory, because block devices (usually hard disks), have higher access time rates for Input/Output operations. For embedded systems the problem is worst since swap area is generally not present in such systems.

Using the same compression algorithm present in JFFS2 filesystems (LZO \cite{obe05lzo, ZivLem77}), swap selected memory pages are compressed and sent to the virtual swap area, called ramzswap. This virtual swap acts like a block device with a swap partition and from Linux kernel point of view, there is no difference from a regular swap partition and ramzswap swap partition. Virtual compressed swap is self-contained and the compression and decompression is done when a page is inserted or retrieved from Compcache. See Figure \ref{fig:compcache}.

 \caption{Swap with virtual block device -- ramzswap.}
 \label{fig:compcache}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Implementation Design}

A virtual block device is configured to have a swap partition and is added to system swaps table. Doing this, the PFRA is used to select the swappable pages and sent them to virtual compressed area (ramzswap).

To avoid fragmentation and improve efficiency, a new memory allocator was developed for Compcache. xvMalloc \cite{ccache09} is based on TLSF (Two Level Segregate Fit) allocator \cite{Masmano04}, which was developed for real-time systems.

General purpose memory allocator, generally are designed to handle allocations bigger than 4 kilobytes, which is the default size for memory pages, on Linux. This new allocator, xvMalloc, is designed to work with very tiny memory allocations, for example 32 bytes, or $3/4$ of default page size. Due to this page size characterist, fragmentation must be avoided since performance is an important issue.

Inherited from TLSF \cite{Masmano04}, xvMalloc \cite{ccache09} has some useful features that are used in Compcache:

\begin{itemize}
\item O(1) Alloc/Free: Except for cases where xvMalloc has to go to system page allocator to get additional memory.
\item Very low fragmentation: In all tests, xvMalloc memory usage is within 12$\%$ of ``Ideal'' allocator.
\end{itemize}

But, xvMalloc has added new features \cite{ccache09}, as follow:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Allocation size is always in range [MIN, MAX] and this is range is small. For Compcache this range is, for example $[32, 3/4 * PAGE_SIZE]$. This avoid fragmentation.
 \item Memory being managed is not backed by any VA. Allocator records $<$pageNum, offset$>$ for each object.
 \item Per object overhead is 4 bytes. In TLSF, this value is 16 bytes.
 \item xvMalloc stores \textbf{exact} object size in object header. This saves additional 2 bytes per object since it is not necessary to store data section beginning.
\end{itemize}

From kernel point-of-view, ramzswap is a normal swap area and must provide a small access time for compressed pages. Low fragmentation results in less time when a compressed page is required by the memory management system. Another important feature implemented by xvMalloc is the size of meta-data for each object. With 4 bytes for each object (or compressed page), more space can be used to store compressed pages itself. The Compcache version presented in \cite{briglia07}, meta-data size is an issue because important bytes were spent to address the compressed pages.

% Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is 
% available on your word processor, please use the font closest in 
% appearance to Times that you have access to.
% 
% MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of 
% the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type. 
% Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and

% 
% The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format. 
% 
% MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use 
% double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6 
% inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, 
% flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank 
% lines between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be 10-point
